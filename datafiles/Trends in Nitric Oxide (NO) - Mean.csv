X axis title: Year
Y axis title: Mean (ppb)
Indicator Name: Nitric Oxide (NO)
Indicator Description: Nitrogen oxides (NOx) which include nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) are a group of pollutants formed by combusion that can cause damage to lung tissue breathing and respiratory problems as well as contribute to smog and acid rain.
Indicator Measure: Mean
Indicator How Calculated: Air samples collected at specific NYCCAS monitoring sites along with information about emissions sources were incorporated into a statistical model that predicted pollutant concentrations at all locations in NYC for the specified time period.  The results were then assigned to the appropriate NYC neighborhood and averaged. In NYCCAS nitric oxide is measured in units of parts per billion (ppb).
Indicator Source(s): New York City Community Air Survey
