,,,,,Trends in Black Carbon - Mean : Chart Over Time
X axis title: Year
Y axis title: Mean (absorbance units)
Indicator Name: Black Carbon
Indicator Description: Black carbon is a major component of fine particulate matter (PM) in the air. Particulate matter is easily inhaled into the lungs and can contribute to both short-term acute health effects as well as long-term chronic illness.
Indicator Measure: Mean
Indicator How Calculated: <p>Air samples collected at specific NYCCAS monitoring sites along with information about emissions sources were incorporated into a statistical model that predicted pollutant concentrations at all locations in NYC for the specified time period. The results were then assigned to the appropriate NYC neighborhood and averaged. Black carbon levels are estimated using a method that measures <a href="http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/Glossary.aspx#Absorbance" target="_blank">absorbance</a>.</p>
