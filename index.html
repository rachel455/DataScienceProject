        <h1>Improvement in Air Quality</h1>
        <img src="images/banner.png" alt="Banner Image"/>
        <p>
            I have shown the pollutant calculation method for each administrative district. 
            It proves that as the trend has decreased, air quality has improved over the years. 
            This issue is very important because air quality affects everything around us, and air pollution has a negative impact on our bodies and lungs, especially young children and the elderly. 
            Recognition of this will contribute to everyone's overall health.

                    <p>
                        Vehicles, building boilers, and other sources of combustion create fine particulate matter (PM2.5), which is the most harmful type of air pollution.
                        The graph on the left shows the trend every year starting from 2009 the amount of Fine Particulate Matter particles in the air has decreased.
                        The dataset of the right the mean amount of the Fine Particulate Matter measured is grouped by the borough of each year.
                        The units of this data is micrograms per cubic meter of air from air samples that were collected.

                            Black Carbon is a component of fine particulate matter. 
                            Black carbon has negative consequences for human health, as well as visibility, ecosystems, agricultural production, and global warming.
                            The graph on the left shows the trend every year starting from 2009 the amount of Black Carbon in the air has decreased.

                            The data was calculatted using a method called absorbance, which measures the amount of light replected by the particulates on a sample filter.

                        <p>
                            Nitric Oxide (NO) is a class of pollutants produced by combustion that can harm lung tissue, induce breathing and respiratory issues, and contribute to smog and acid rain.
                            The graph on the left shows the trend every year starting from 2009 the amount of Nitric Oxide in the air has decreased.
                            The dataset of the right the mean amount of the Nitric Oxide measured is grouped by the borough of each year.
                            The data was measured in parts per billion from air samples that were collected.

                            Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) is a toxic gas produced by the oxidation of nitric oxide or combustion in the presence of air and is a prevalent air contaminant.
                            The graph on the left shows the trend every year starting from 2009 the amount of Nitrogen Dioxide in the air has decreased.

                            Ozone (O3) is a prevalent air contaminant that can cause breathing problems and exacerbate asthma and other respiratory illnesses.
                            The graph on the left shows the trend every year starting from 2008, the Ozone data in the air has decreased, however there has been a few years that has shown an increase.
                            The dataset of the right the mean amount of the Ozone data measured is grouped by the borough of each year.

                            Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) is produced from the combustion of some fuel oils. As an air pollutant, it can aggravate lung disease
                            The graph on the left shows the trend every year starting from 2008 the amount of Sulfur Dioxide in the air has decreased.
                            The dataset of the right the mean amount of the Sulfur Dioxide measured is grouped by the borough of each year, by 2015 the data for each borough were very closely related.
                            The data was measured in parts per billion from air samples that were collected.
