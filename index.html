        <h1>Improvement in Air Quality</h1>
        <img src="images/banner.png" alt="Banner Image"/>
        <p>
            I have shown the claculated means of the pollutants for each borough. 
            Proving the improvements in air quality over the years as the trends decrease. 
            This is important because air quality affects everything around us, and air pollution has a negative impact on our bodies and lungs, especially young children and the elderly. 
            Recognition of this will contribute to everyone's overall health.

                    <p>
                        Fine Particulate Matter (PM2.5) are emitted by vehicles, building boilers, and other combustion - and are a major form of air pollution that harms health.

                        <p>
                            Black Carbon is a major component of fine particulate matter (PM) in the air. 
                            Particulate matter is easily inhaled into the lungs and can contribute to both short-term acute health effects, as well as long-term chronic illness.

                            Nitric Oxide (NO) is a group of pollutants formed by combustion that can cause damage to lung tissue, breathing and respiratory problems, as well as contribute to smog and acid rain.

                            Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) - comes from burning certain types of fuel oil. 
                            As an air pollutant, it can worsen lung diseases.
